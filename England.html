<h1>Euromoon - England</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Day 1 - 08 Dec 2015 - Tuesday</h2>
<p>Tuesday was a lazy day with a sleep in.  The actuality of the adventure ahead still not quite real.  A few last minute decisions before treating myself to a facial thanks to Mary. </p>

<p>My first Uber ride (that I paid for) was a lovely experience.  ANNNND CHEAP! Although the lollies and water I’d heard about were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Hello Brisbane International Airport!</p>
<p>A reasonably painless transition through check in and customs found us with 2 hrs to kill before our flight.  </p>

<h2>Day 2 - 09 Dec 2015 - Wednesday</h2>
<p>00:50 departure to Hong Kong with a flight time of 8 hrs and 15 min</p>
<img width="70%" src="Photos/IMG_5518.JPG"> 
<p>2 hr layover in Hong Kong</p>
<p>13 hr flight to London</p>
<p>on check in for the London flight was super disappointed to find that Lang and I were not seated together :-(</p>
<p>Great view from 46E - The back of my head sitting in 45E</p>
<img width="70%" src="Photos/IMG_0367.JPG">
<p>3 movies, 2 TV shows, multiple awkward bathroom visits and 13 hrs later we touch down at Heathrow International Airport</p>
<p>Walking out of the plane and across the air bridge at 15:00 local time I was surprised to see the sun already setting.  Lazy bastard!</p>
<p>The colours in the London early afternoon sun set reminded me of Roma (QLD)</p>

<h2>Day 3 - 10 Dec 2015 - Thursday</h2>
<p>No surprise we were up early.  I had passed out by 19:30 the night before completely oblivious to the sound of the rumbling underground gently vibrating through our hotel room.</p>
<p>Dressed and out the hotel door just after 05:00 local time (approx 15:00 Brisbane time)</p>
<p>First tube ride of the day</p>
<img width="70%" src="Photos/IMG_5530.JPG">
<p>Lang and I touristed the shit out of inner London.</p>
<p>I was shocked when we walked out of Westminster Station approx 10 min later and BOOM! There was Big Ben in all his glory!</p>
<img width="70%" src="Photos/IMG_5531.JPG">
