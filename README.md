# Euromoon-Blog
Shaack 2015-2016 Europe Trip
This is my first project.
My fiance and I decided to do a big European trip that we have justified by calling our Honeymoon.  
Except that we are not getting married until April 2016.  Meh.  Who cares?? EUROMOON it is.
The idea is that coding a blog from scratch while on the road would present a lot of unique learning opportunities.
I only had 1 rule.
I must understand the code that I use.  
I hope you enjoy it.
It has been a wonderful love/hate experience for me.  
One that I would never have made it through without the patience and support of my fiance Lang.
