# Euromoon-Blog

Shaack 2015-2016 Europe Trip

This is my first project.  
I have only attended RailsGirls.  No other coding experience.  
Everything I put together was learned on the road reading free tutorials generously uploaded by others or patiently explained by my fiance Lang who is a Ruby developer.

My fiance and I decided to do a big European trip that we have justified by calling our Honeymoon.  
Except that we are not getting married until April 2016.  Meh.  Who cares?? EUROMOON it is.

This seemed like the perfect opportunity to do an interesting project.
The idea is that coding a blog from scratch while on the road would present a lot of unique learning opportunities.  
I only had 1 rule.
I must understand the code that I use.  Hence why it is only in HTML and CSS.
I hope you enjoy it.
It has been a wonderful love/hate experience for me.  
One that I would never have made it through without the patience and support of Lang.
