			<p>1840 sees us roll into the Paris tired and hungry but supa excited.  We are in Paris.  We catch the metro 15 min to the hotel and check in.  A room change later and we out on the hunt for food.   We have some luck as the restaurant across from the hotel has a steak, beans and chips meal.  Done.  Oh my gawd.  They even gook the steak gooooood! </p>
			<p>A bit of exploring and some blog work sees us through to bed time.</p>

			<h3>Tuesday - 05 Jan 2016</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="post_text">
			<p>A terrible night&apos;s sleep due to the noise out in the street has us sluggish and uninterested in touristing when the alarm goes off.  We snooze till the last possible moment before we have to go down to the included (yes.  It is actually included this time.  I double checked) breakfast.  After a sombre meal we climb back into bed and have another sleep.</p>
			<p>It is amazing what a good sleep can do for your mood.  By 1300 we are up and ready to tackle Paris.  We head towards the river and find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Bourse">Paris Bourse</a> (Bourse de Paris or Palais Brongniart in French) which was a 19th-century stock exchange, now a conference venue.</p>
			<p>Our next discovery is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Palais_Royal"> 17th-century The Royal Place</a> (Le Palais Royal) &amp; gardens with arcades of shops and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Deux_Plateaux">Daniel Buren&apos;s</a> striped columns in the courtyard.</p>
			<p>From here it is only a block to the Louvre.  I didn&apos;t know this.  I didn&apos;t actually really have much of a clue where we were.  Only that we were still heading vaguely in the direction of the River.  Now, Lang who has been to Paris a couple of times knew where we were and what was coming up.  Cue &quot;expectant face&quot; for him has we cross the road and then BAM!! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre"> The Louvre</a>. </p>
			<p>We have a day set aside for actually entering the Louvre so we wander around the controversial<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvre_Pyramid"> glass pyramid</a> and then head in the direction of the Arc de Triomphe.   As we leave the massive court yard area of the Louvre and cross the road into the Tuileries Garden (Jardin des Tuileries) I get my first look at the Eiffel Tower.  *excited face*</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage1.PNG">
			<p>Onward passed the Carrousel du Louvre which is another arc just smaller. Down through the gardens until we get to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Roue_de_Paris">Grande Roue de Paris</a> (Paris Eye) where the area is chock a block with souvenir stores *squee* in we go.  Lang and I have developed this morbid obsession of looking at souvenir stores.  We don&apos;t usually buy anything but the range of items seems to fascinate us.</p>
			<p>As we move down the Avenue Champs-Elysees the souvenir stores turn more into established Christmas markets that are still playing Christmas carols.  Have you seen the date?!?! These guys are milking Christmas Holiday Season for ALLLLL it&apos;s worth!! Bloody hell! If I never hear another Christmas carol again it still maybe too soon.
			As we walk further towards the Arc the Christmas market vendors change to proper stores and some flash ones at that.  Mercedes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton to name a few.  We arrived at the Arc with perfect timing as it is not long until dusk.  Just the huge stair case to negotiate to get to a breathtaking view.  Magic.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage2.PNG">
			<p>After all that walking we decide to take the metro back to the vicinity of the hotel and hunt down some food.  I am DYING for a salad.  So Vietnamese it is.  I stalk a selection of restaurants through trip advisor and off we go.  The first 2 are closed but we catch a break on the third one and finally settle in for a lovely meal at 2000.</p>
			<p>During our exploring for the restaurant we found several poles, bins and basically anywhere with a flat surface with a BNE sticker on it.  *snigger*</p>
			<p>With full bellies we waddle the 20 min back to the hotel and have an early night.</p>

			<p>Today we are going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris">Notre Dame</a>!!  OH ... MY ... GAWD!! The actual Notre Dame!! My enthusiasm is curbed after an hour of waiting in line though.  Especially when the reality of the several hundred steps to get to the top kicks in about half way up.</p>
			<p>I must admit that I was quite astounded by the grove in the stairs made by an unknown number of feet.  I took a photo but the angle did not show how deep the stone stairs had been worn away.</p>
			<p>The view is of course amazing.   A multitude of photos and selfies were taken.</p>
			<p>By the time we get back to ground level it is 1230.  We have a date with our favourite tour company <a href="http://www.neweuropetours.eu/">New Europe Tours</a> at 1300 so our schedule is tight.  We forego the internal look of Notre Dame to another day.</p>
		<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage4.PNG">
			<p>Our host is Alexandre.  A rather tall French man with excellent English.  He indulges us with the explanation that his Father is an American who fell in love with his French mother ... Naaaaawww.</p>
			<p>He is everything you would want in a tour guide.  Charming, knowledgeable and passionate.  The 3 hours is up too soon and I am once again grateful for the experience.  </p>
			<p>A quick pee stop at Starbucks and we head back to the hotel to regroup, get some washing done and have a crack at one of the local burger joints (reminded me of a Hungry Jacks).</p>

			<p>We hit the breakfast buffet and wiggle our way to the metro.  Not long after the Louver has opened we pick up the audio guides and begin to work our way through the complex.  It is MASSIVE.</p>
			<p>I was surprised by the number of paintings showing breastfeeding.  *insert mildly confused face*</p>
		<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage7.PNG">
			<p>We jammed so much information in our heads that we need to have a morning tea break.  20 minutes later we hit it again.  I was surprised at how small the Mona Lisa was ... I was amused by all the people taking selfies! :-)
			<p>By 1530 we were done so headed towards the Eiffel Tower. </p>
			<p>To my surprise we walk passed the Australian Embassy.   I insist on a selfie.  Lang is convinced we are going to be arrested.  &quot;That could be fun!&quot; :-D</p>
			<p>Our luck with lines has finally run out and the wind picks up to reinforce the realisation.  We wait patiently for approx. an hour chatting with the American father and daughter behind us.  On paying for our tickets we are advised that we cannot go to the top due to maintenance.  *sad face* </p>
			<p>It doesn&apos;t really affect us.  I still find the view amazing and the plus is that on the middle level you can see the twinkling of the lights to better effect.  I was surprised to find a skating rink on the bottom level.  Slightly random.</p>

			<p>After smashing the breakfast buffet we hitch a ride on the metro to check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Chapelle">Sainte-Chapelle</a>.  This 13th century church is made almost entirely of stained glass.  There is almost no stone wall at all.  After several hours listening to the interpretation of the windows we head off to check out the inside of the Notre Dame. </p>
		<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage8.PNG">
		<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage9.PNG">
			<p>I am supa impressed by all the little alcoves dedicated to different people.  Amazing glass windows, architecture and mosaics.</p>
			<p>On a side note it was interesting to find a photo shoot happening out the front.  The subjects were an Asian man and women in full wedding gear.  His suit was shinny white and her dress and veil were ENORMOUS.</p>
			<p>Our next stop is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacr%C3%A9-C%C5%93ur,_Paris">The Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Paris (Sacre-Coeur Basilica)</a> which is situated on top of hill over looking Paris.  I of course find a cat to play with which does seem to be a recurring theme.  I am not upset by this in the slightest.</p>
			<p>Tourist stop 3 for the day is the Moulin Rouge.  Disappointing in my view but then I LOVE the movie.  Either way we had an enjoyable stop out the front eating chocolates from an amazing chocolate shop and enjoying the ambiance before heading off to stop 4 for the day.</p>
		<img class="post_image" src="Photos/paris_collage10.PNG">
			<p>At this point Lang and I part ways.  Lang heads to the football.  I cheer from the comforts of a bar nearby showing the same game on a big screen.  I work on my French by ordering several cocktails.  Winning! </p>

		<p>Today we leave for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Paris"> DISNEY LAND PARIS</a>!!!! I'm not excited at all!!</p>
		<p>The hour train trip out is comfortable and we arrive at Val D Europe about 1130 as luck has it our room is ready and it is beautiful.  Except ... Twin fucking beds pushed together to make a double.  *facepalm*  I'm totally flabbergasted that a 4 star hotel and a deluxe suit would not have a queen bed.  FFS!</p>
		<p>After some huffing and puffing from my end I concoct my revenge by advising Lang that we won't be spending a cent in the hotel.  So we take advantage of the kitchenette by heading to the local shopping center and buying a tone of salad, cheeses and cured meats.  All of which are delicious.</p>
		<p>Once we have the food stowed away in the fridge we head down and make use of our complimentary Disney Land pick up and drop off service.</p>
