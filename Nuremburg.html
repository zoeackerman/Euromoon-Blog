			<p>The German boarder also brings double digits to the electronic thermometer.   This is pleasing until I realise that it means there probably won&apos;t be snow for Christmas.  *sad face*</p>
			<p>1600 has us pulling into the Nuremberg train station 20 minutes early.  Time for a bathroom break before we head out to find Matt.  Cue perfect timing to run out of change for the bathrooms (remembering you have to pay to go to the loo in Europe).  Lang heads off and leaves me with the bags.  A few minutes later and bless his soul he not only returns with change but a gift bag for the goodies that we brought with us for Mel & Matt.  WINNING!!</p>
			<p>The Ladies bathroom is eyebrow raising to say the least.  Firstly it is BRIGHT lime green and secondly after you flush the toilet the seat automatically cleans itself.  I shit you not.   I&apos;ll insert a video of it once I figure out how to do that but for now you will just have to imagine the a cleaning pad coming out of the wall and the seat rotating as it is wiped with antiseptic fluid of some description.  Well I got my Euros worth on THAT trip!!</p>
			<p>Europeans coming to Australia and using our public toilets must think we are barbarians!! I say bring on the paying 50 cents to use the bathroom at the beach.  Especially if it means the toilets will be clean, tidy and most importantly stocked with soap and paper!!</p>
			<p>I relay my bathroom adventure to Lang and we head out to the front of the building.  I am not surprised when Matt is waiting patiently for us.  HUGS ALL ROUND!!!</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/nuremburg_collage1.PNG">
			<p>A quick burn down the Autobarn and we arrive in the small town that Matt, Mel and their daughter Leilani live in.  Wendelstein. Their house is pleasantly warm after the cool hit of air outside.  The rest of the family is waiting for us in the main area.  Christmas tree and nibbles set up to go.  Nom nom nom biscuits!!!</p>
			<p>Considering one of the gifts that we brought with us for the family, I make the executive decision that at least our (recently glammed up) offering be opened before dinner.  Mel agrees and so a little present swapping keeps us amused until dinner time.</p>
			<p>Mel&apos;s parents have given Matt a bit of a joke present.  While in the shopping district of Nuremberg they found a pullover with a Rockhampton image.  As both Matt and I hail from "RockVegas" it was a mix of emotions.  Both hilarious and horrifying.</p>
			<p>Fondue is on the menu this evening.  Meat fondue.  A first for me.  Sooooo just like cheese or chocolate but you cook your meat in the oil and then add to sauces, bread or salads.  Delicious!
			The rest of the night is spent catching up.  We talk well into the night and early morning.</p>

			<p>After the celebrations the previous night Lang and I take the opportunity to have a lay in until about 0930.  The smell of Mel cooking pancakes brings us down to the kitchen.  Unfortunately overnight the sniffle that started yesterday has turned into a full&ndash;fledged head cold today.  <i>*Marvellous*</i></p>
			<p>After a leisurely breakfast we load up the car and Mel plays the part of tour guide.  She is very keen to introduce us to her home town.  The concept of being patriotic about your home town is a little foreign.  If anyone asks ... I&apos;m from Brisbane until proven otherwise.  Just ask Matt :-) </p>
			<p>We drive by several of the buildings commissioned by Hitler and the court house where the Nuremburg trials were held after the Second World War. </p> 
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/nuremburg_collage3.PNG">
			<p>Next we park the car and have some lunch in an Italian restaurant - Cafe &amp; Bar &ndash; Celona.  Cute name.  The food is delicious and the staff are enthusiastic.</p>
			<p>A wander through the centre of town where the Christmas market were.  No surprise they are closed today.  I am however surprised at how much is open.  Cafes and shops to name a few.  There are also lots of people out and about including walking tours in a variety of languages.  Next we head up the hill to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Castle">Imperial Castle of Nuremberg</a>.  The view is lovely and as we mount the summit just before sunset the timing pays off. </p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/nuremburg_collage5.PNG">
			<p>Mel takes Leilani to her Grandparents&apos; house while Matt shows us the &quot;Marriage Fountain&quot;.  Clearly whoever designed and commissioned it did not have a good experience with marriage.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/nuremburg_collage4.PNG">
			<p>After some more exploring and enjoying the Christmas lights we find a pub and have a few sneaky drinks.  While waiting for Mel to join us Matt and I do a thorough examination of the cocktail menu.   We soon regroup and head off for some dinner in a nearby Mexican restaurant.  The food is what you would expect although I did raise my eyebrows at the green corn chips.</p>
			<p>Next is Star Wars - The Force Awakens.  I am very excited although still rather sick.  After todays walk Lang buys me an extra big coke to help keep me awake through the 2015 showing.  Unfortunately this means I need to go to the bathroom before the end.  Yeah.  I was that guy.  *embarrassed face*</p>
			<p>Mel had decided to have a date with Mr Bond while Matt, Lang and I went to Star Wars. We all met up for a drink and ice&ndash;cream to debrief.  By then it was after 2300 so we headed back to home.  I was thoroughly knackered.</p>

			<p>I sleep through the 0800 alarm.  Lang waking me at the latest possible time.  My head cold is still with us. *unlucky* At least it is just a travel day and I can sleep most of the way.</p>
			<p>We say our good buys to Mel and then load up the car for Matt to drop us back at the train station.  Our 1 hour trip to Munich is in First Class and is possibly the best we&apos;ve had.  Free drinks and snacks.  Comfortable chairs, PowerPoints and the carriage is only about 30% full.  Unfortunately I squandered most of niceties by sleeping through the majority of the trip.  We change trains at Munich to continue on to Venice and this train is packed.  Every seat is taken and there are suitcases and people in the aisles.  We also only have second Class tickets.  I&apos;m now such a snob.</p>
			<p>We are seated side by side and facing another couple.  Awkward.  I avoid the faces of the other couple by going back to sleep for another hour and later working on the computer.  We are relieved when they depart the train and we have the 4 seats to ourselves.  Inopportunely this doesn&apos;t last long.  I amuse myself on the computer as we do have power points. </p>
			<p>By 1300 my first glimpses of snow appear in the shadows beside the tracks about 10&ndash;15 km across the Austrian border.   This small patches break way to larger areas and soon anywhere that hasn&apos;t been touched by the sun has a moderate covering of white.</p>
			<p>By 1430 vineyards start to appear abundantly along the train line.  A quick check of our location confirms that we have crossed the border into Italy.   Another 3.5 hours and we arrive at our destination.  Venice. </p>
