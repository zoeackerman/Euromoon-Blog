			<p>We arrive at Berlin train station and I am ... without words ... at the size of the place.  The open space and the 4 story Christmas Tree are quite a spectacle.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/Berlin Collage.PNG">
			<p>We arrived in Berlin quite late and opted to get food at the train station before heading out to the taxi line.  I manage to find the only German taxi driver that doesn&apos;t speak English.  It was actually quite arrogant of me to think that all the taxi drivers would some English.  Later when telling this story to a German I was asked if the driver was actually German or an immigrant.   I didn&apos;t know.  Seems like somethings are the same no matter where you go.</p>
			<p>Our Mercure hotel is neat and tidy though the building is quite old.  Our concierge is very helpful and points out where the local public transport stops are and the most efficient tickets for our needs.  Once we are checked in I hit the tourist pamphlets and we head up to our room ... in the slowest ... lift ... of ... all ... time.   Seriously.  Come on.</p>
			<p>Our room seems to have lots of unnecessary doors for a 1 bedroom apartment.  My guess, by the design of the glass internal doors, is that the building is of the 1960&apos;s era though the bathroom and decor are certainly not that old.  It creates an odd contrast.</p>
			<p>By now it is nearly 2100 so we decide to stay in and plan out the next couple of days.  I also upload the latest additions to the blog.  Well at least I hope it uploads overnight.</p>

			<p>The alarm sounds at 0730.  Apparently I don&apos;t notice and Lang has to wake me up. I&apos;d had a terrible night sleep so begrudgingly get out of bed to catch a 0800 bus.  Lang and I walk out of the hotel and are greeted with a spectacular clear sky and a fresh 8 degrees.   It is beautiful.</p>
			<p>A grumpy bus driver, transit day pass and successfully negotiated bus trip later and we arrive at Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburg Tor) Square.  The Starbucks on the corner is the meeting place for today&apos;s tour.  One of my objectives for this trip is to not use chain stores that we have at home.  Like Starbucks.  Unfortunately it is the only place open selling food.  I skulk in order my green tea, breakfast and sandwiches for the day (apparently there will be no options for purchasing food or drinks for about 5 hours) we eat our breakfast with a perfect view of the Tor.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/Berlin Collage1.PNG">
			<p>Our guide, Sebastian, arrives and we start our 50 min journey to Sachsenhausen via city train, rural train then rural bus.</p>
			<p>Sachsenhausen is the site of the first purpose built concentration camp.  It&apos;s located on the outskirts of a small town called Oranienburg. </p> 
			<p>As we regroup from the trip out to the site the guide hands out maps and we take the opportunity for a bathroom break.  All set and rugged up for the day we venture out to the main area of the building remains.  Some of the buildings are intact, some have been restored and others are missing entirely after the components were cannibalised after the war.</p>
			<p>Our guide is incredibly knowledgeable and I learn more about the camps and the holocaust in this one day than I had learned my entire life.  It is devastatingly horrific.  There are 5 &quot;Ackermanns&quot; recorded in the Sachsenhausen book of the Dead.  However, there are estimates as high as 200k of unrecorded fatalities.  I wonder if any of them are related.  Where they Jews or Political prisoners?  Wrong place, wrong time?</p>
			<p>At 1400 we leave Oranienburg.  I have a deep sense of foreboding.  Learning of the propaganda and tactics used by Hitler and the Nazi Government against the Jews to fuel the justification for the holocaust, I can&apos;t help but compare what I learned with the ongoing &quot;news&quot; articles about Muslims and terrorism seen on TV today.
			We leave Sachsenhausen at 1400 and head back to Berlin.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/Berlin Collage2.PNG">
			<p>40 min trip back to the centre of Berlin and we get off at the nearest station to Legoland.  It is now 1500 and the sun is setting creating a beautiful vista of Christmas lights and markets.  Out of nowhere an enormous Lego giraffe appears.  Looks like we have found the place.</p>
			<p>We meander around the area stopping wherever our hearts desire.  Eating bits here and there.  I come across roasting chestnuts and am excited by memories of eating them in the Kovacevic household.  Unfortunately the local chestnuts don&apos;t hold up and I am left disappointed.  *sad face*</p>
			<p>Some more window shopping and Lang finds a scarf he likes.  It is a smart investment.  We are spending most of our time in Berlin outside.  Our guide had advised us earlier today that todays 11 degrees was out of season and usually it would be -5 degrees at this time of year.  While I am grateful for the mild weather it does mean no snow. *supa sad face*</p>
			<p>1800 we arrive back at the hotel to pick up our washing and hunt for a Laundromat.  Trip advisor has only one standout candidate for our area.  Done.  We pack up and head out again.  3 stops down the tram line we eventually figure out how to put our washing on (at least there is a change machine) and leave them to their fate while we go the adjoining caf√© for some dinner.   It never ceases to amaze me how I expect everything to be in English and how surprised I am when it is not.  FFS.</p>
			<p>At some point I had been given a 10 Euro note with one of the corners ripped off.  When I tried to hand this over for our dinner the Elton John channeling staff member wouldn&apos;t have a bar of it.   This of course is the last note I have on me and therefore I now have to hand over all my change for the washing machines.  I do so with an accompanying snotty attitude.  Fingers crossed there is enough left over for the dryers.  
			We spend the time working on the computers and chatting to the room full of Aussies and New Zealanders.  Doesn&apos;t appear there is anywhere in the world you can get away from the bastards.  :-D</p>
			<p>By 2130 we&apos;ve made it back to the hotel room, dropped off the clothes and are back out exploring.  This time we hit up the Alexander Platz Christmas Markets.  Its full of the same stuff as we have been seeing in the other markets.  What we do find of interest is currywurst.  I take the challenge which I find is actually really good.  Later we top up with a bratwurst but it is a little bland after the currywurst.</p>
			<p>Some more poking around and by 2230 everything was closing.  We took the hint and walked the 15 min back to the hotel</p>

			<p>The alarm wakes us to a drizzling dark morning.  The sun is struggling to put in an appearance.  The 1000 walking tour with <a href="http://www.neweuropetours.eu/">New Europe Tours</a> that we were going to go on this morning is shelved till 1400.  According to the weather report it will have cleared up by then.</p>
			<p>We take our time getting ready to go out buy by 1000 our bellies are calling for food.  We head out to Alexander Platz again and vanquish the hunger with a toasted open sandwich.  We head on closer to the meeting point and again trawl the souvenir shops.  I find a bunch of rubber duckys in various outfits ... this makes me very happy.  I&apos;m not sure why rubber ducks dressed up works for me ... but it does.  Go figure.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/Berlin Collage4.PNG">
			<p>At 1400 our tour guide George, an American from Missouri, arrives and takes us on our adventure.  He has a great background in German history and has been living in Berlin for 8 years.  George&apos;s approach to the tours is clearly trying to teach as many people as possible about the politics of the Nazi regime and how the outcome of those policies can repeat themselves in today&apos;s society.  His tour covers many places including what is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_Murdered_Jews_of_Europe">Holocaust Memorial</a>, <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate">Brandenburg Gate</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie">Checkpoint Charlie</a> and discusses the role of many other sites in the city during the regime.</p>
			<p>After gawking at the location of where Checkpoint Charlie was the tour finishes up at about 1630.  In the illustrious words of George &quot;Hollywood&apos;s Checkpoint Charlie&quot;.  It is an apt description.  I was bemused by the men dressed in replica WW2 American uniforms that you can pay money to have your photo taken with.  Amused mostly by the irony of them being obviously Russian.  Commercialism at its best.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/Berlin Collage5.PNG">
			<p>Next mission is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side_Gallery">East Side Gallery</a>.  We catch the metro to a nearby station.  As we leave there is a Vietnamese Restaurant.  Oh my GAWD! A salad.  I&apos;d kill for a decent salad.  We head on in and in my English and his German/Vietnamese/English I place an order for a cabbage based Vietnamese salad with chicken and a chicken yellow curry for Lang.</p>
			<p>When the waiter returns he puts one meal on the table nods and walks off.  We look at the plate ... look expectantly at him ... nope he&apos;s on his phone.  Body language clearly states job done.   Hmmmmmm ... what we get is a chicken curry with a side of cabbage based salad.  Close enough.  Nom nom nom.  It&apos;s actually pretty good and cheap too.  We pay our money say out thanks and head off over the bridge to the East Side Gallery.
			We walk the entire length of the Gallery.  Mostly in silence as we contemplate the possible meanings behind the artists&apos; work.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/Berlin Collage6.PNG">
			<p>Lang and I continue walking towards our hotel until we find a Beer Hall.   The call of pork knuckle is too strong ... in we go.  Lang orders a half litre of beer and as there is no vodka or gin ( blasphemy ) I decide to try the shots.  I start at the top and work my way down.  The first one is a strawberry schnapps, it is very nice.  The next 3 however are all awful so I give up.  We are both full of food to overflowing and with the heat of the beer hall are struggling to stay awake.   We roll ourselves home and into bed.</p>

			<p>The 0700 alarm sounds as we sluggishly drag our arses out of bed.  We joke about not being hungry from last night&apos;s endeavor as we repack our bags for the next leg of the journey.   Out into the cold for the 0810 bus to the train station.  We frantically purchase reservation tickets with 10 min to spare to get to the platform (Berlin to Prague was the only leg we could purchase a reservation online before we left Australia).</p>
			<p>Our cabin seems to be popular as there are two German men, 3 Asians and two American ladies plus the two of us trying to occupy the 6 seater cabin.  Someone has their tickets mixed up.   The Americans are in the wrong carriage and well ... the Asians had just taken a punt that no one would show up with a reservation.  That just let the Germans and us in a 6 seater.  WINNING.</p>
			<p>The first two hours passes in relative silence.  I don&apos;t know if the German men can speak English.  Though I know they are at least civil human beings as when I opened my bottle of coke it sprayed out over me and one of the German men were kind enough to hand me a wet wipe to clean up.  The look on his face as I said my thanks clearly indicated pity for my current situation.  His kindness was greatly appreciated.</p> 
			<p>Both were well dressed and presented.  Their speech and tone indicated they were also well educated which made me think they may at least have limited English.</p>
			<p>About two hours into the journey as we crossed the German/Czech boarder I got excited as there appeared to be a waterfall in the distance.  It wasn&apos;t so, however it did get a reaction from the Germans in English and we were off.  I ended up questioning and discussing politics, tourists, world socioeconomics and traveling in a country whose native language differs from your own.  I had a great time and was sad to leave them on the train headed to Budapest as we exited for Prague.  I was so distracted talking and our stop arrived so suddenly that I didn&apos;t even ask their names before we left.</p>
