<h1>Day 1 - 08 Dec 2015 - Tuesday</h1>
<p>Hello Brisbane International Airport!</p>
<p>My first Uber ride (that I paid for) was a lovely experience.  ANNNND CHEAP!</p>

<h1>Day 2 - 09 Dec 2015 - Wednesday</h1>
<p>00:50 departure to Hong Kong with a flight time of 8 hrs and 15 min</p>
<!-- width of 40% wont be visible on mobile -->
<img width="40%" src="Photos/IMG_5518.JPG"> 
<p>2 hr layover in Hong Kong</p>
<p>13 hr flight to London</p>
<p>on check in for the London flight was super disappointed to find that Lang and I were not seated together :-(</p>
<p>Great view from 46E ... The back of my head sitting in 45E</p>
<img width="40%" src="Photos/IMG_0367.JPG">
<p>3 movies, 2 TV shows, multiple awkward bathroom visits and 13 hrs later we touch down at Heathrow International Airport</p>
<p>Walking out of the plane and across the airbridge at 15:00 local time I was surprised to see the sun already setting.  Lazy bastard!</p>
<p>The colours in the London early afternoon sun set reminded me of Roma (QLD)</p>

<h1>Day 3 - 10 Dec 2015 - Thursday</h1>
<p>No surprise we were up early.  I had passed out by 19:30 the night before completely oblivious to the sound of the rumbling underground gently vibrating through our hotel room.</p>
<p>Dressed and out the hotel door just after 05:00 local time (approx 15:00 Brisbane time)</p>
<p>First tube ride of the day</p>
<img width="40%" src="Photos/IMG_5530.JPG">
<p>Lang and I touristed the shit out of inner London.</p>
<p>I was shocked when we walked out of Westminster Station approx 10 min later and BOOM! There was Big Ben in all his glory!</p>
<img width="40%" src="Photos/IMG_5531.JPG">
<p>21,000 steps later and we had visited:</p>
<p>Parliament House</p>
<p>Parliament Square</p>
<p>Trafalgar Square</p>
<p>London Eye</p>
<p>Downing Street</p>
<p>Covet Garden Markets</p>
<p>Piccadilly Circus (Spoiler: There are no clowns)</p>
<p>Leicester Square</p>
