			<p>Lang and I struggle our luggage onto the platform at Prague and Wow.  It is colder here.  Another 5 degree drop at a guess.  I decide to pull my big jacket and gloves out of my suitcase before we get out onto the street.  Good call as one of the German boys sticks his head out of the door of the train waving a black kindle.  My black kindle.  Faaaaarrrrrrkkk that was close.  I wave my gratitude as the train pulls out.  If they had found it 2 minutes later or we had not stayed on the platform it would have been gone.</p> 
			Rugged up we head out on foot via cobblestone streets to our hotel.  This is where we will be spending our 5 year anniversary.  It certainly could be worse.  We had asked the travel agent for something a little flash for the event but I was not expecting what we saw when we walked into the lobby area to check in.  Flash as.  Big staircases and adornment everywhere.</p>
			<p>I did find it interesting that the room key was needed to operate the lift when you could just walk up the massive spiral staircase next to it.   Whatever makes you feel better?!?</p>
			Our room is lovely and has a reasonable view of a garden/summer cafe.  Again the room temperature is set to Queensland so I open the massive windows to cool it down.  The thermostat also gets turned back for good measure.  Don&apos;t these people know that I brought my own portable radiator (Lang)?!?!?!</p> 
			<p>Once the phones and computers are plugged in to recharge and are Wi-Fi enabled we head out for some lunch.  Down the main street there is a kebab style cafe place.  Sold.  I get everything you would expect in a kebab at home except it is on a plate not wrapped in pita.</p>
			<p>The tour pamphlets we picked up included a river cruise with dinner which sounds like a great idea for our first night in Prague.  The hotel kindly books the cruise for us and shows us on our paper map where the pick up point is, an easy 10 min walk away.  A flash new mini bus chauffers us to the departure point on the river.  The boat and it&apos;s furnishings are older but neat, tidy and well presented.  The staff are efficient and attentive.  The views lovely.  Our first sightseeing milestone is the King Charles Bridge. <!-- insert link --> The bridge and it&apos;s statues are lit up at night giving it a majestically eerie look.</p>
			<p>The boat continues up the river into a lock where dinner is served.  A hearty goulash, chicken schnitzels, cold meats, cheeses, pickles and cakes for dessert.  Once we had eaten our fill of food and booze we went upstairs to the viewing platform.  We spent most of the return trip taking photos of the beautiful riverside and cracking each other up over silly drunkenness.</p>   
			<p>There were several tour boats waiting in the lock when we arrived.  It seemed to be of particular amusement in our current state that our little Christmas trees were the only ones not decorated.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/prague_collage1.PNG">
			<p>2200 saw us returned to our pick up point on the river.  The price of the cruise did not include return to our original pick up point so we meandered our way back towards the hotel.  On our way we found a casino. *insert evil grin*  After our experience with Amsterdam I was interested to see how this would go.  We had a couple of hundred in local currency and split it between us which worked out to about $AUS25 each and went our separate ways, Lang to the blackjack tables and me to the roulette tables.</p>  
			<p>I soon returned to Lang as there was no one on the roulette tables and the idea of playing by myself did not appeal. A couple of drinks and about an hour later we both went to the roulette table while still not as fun as playing with a table full of people it was better than by myself.  I had a couple of small wins and when we called it quits for the night we were only about $AUS15 down.  Good night if you ask me.  Lang and I made it the rest of the way back to the hotel and fell into bed.</p>

			<h3>Wednesday - 23 Dec 2015</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="post_text">

			<p>The day starts with hunting and gathering some breakfast.  A stall selling local sausage served with horseradish and mustard is the winner.   Just what a tourist needs to fuel up before starting a 3 hr walking tour.</p>
 			<p>Our tour guide Katerina is a tiny little blond <!--*Bolivian*--> lady and soon has us on our way.  The tour covers the milestones in the very long history of the Czech Republic while escorting us to places like the Clock Tower. <!-- insert more details --></p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/prague_collage2.PNG">
 			<p>The tour finishes at 1300 so we head back to the hotel room for short break before heading up to the palace.  Sunset starts between 1530 and 1600 with full dark at about 1645.  We plan to be up at the castle overlooking the city by then.  The palace is about 5 km from our hotel so we elect to get a tram.  Tickets are 24 crown each (about $AUS1.50) with a validity of 30 min.  The map is rather complicated but we get there in the end with plenty of time before sunset.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/prague_collage3.PNG">
 			The palace grounds, buildings and view are beautiful.  I had no idea how big Prague was.  The view extends as far as the eye can see.</p>
 			<p>There are stalls selling grilled corn and potato on a stick.  Om nom nom.  We then explore the town in the direction of the hotel.  When we arrive we pick up the computers and make ourselves comfortable at the Beer Restaurant across the road.   3 cocktails and several local dishes later our schedule has us booked for a 90 min Thai massage.</p>
			<p>Aside from the required footwear the massage is total bliss.  I hear Lang snore several times.  The best praise for a masseuse if you ask me.</p>
			<img class="post_image" src="Photos/prague_collage4.PNG">
			<p>By 2200 we are thoroughly relaxed, though covered in oil, we amble back the short and &quot;<i>refreshing</i>&quot; walk to the hotel.  A long, hot and relaxing shower to wash off and we settle into our big comfortable bed for the night.</p>

			<p>After turning the light out at 0030 this morning a 0930 alarm was appreciated.  We are usually awake before it anyway but one does enjoy lying in bed.  However, the train awaits so we motivate ourselves out of bed at the sound of the alarm and pack for Nuremburg.</p>
			<p>Burger King for breakfast.  Convenience and curiosity got the better of us.  No onion rings though.  Tisk Tisk.  
			This dynamic duo pull ourselves together and head out to the departure boards to find out where our bus is.</p>
			<p>No mater the intensity of our eyeballs we could not see our bus on the boards.  <i>*insert panic attack*</i>  We dash down to the Information desk and nervously wait our turn while watching the departure time race towards us.  Instructions are gratefully received and we sprint through the terminal to the departure platform.  With minutes left we board the most comfortable long distance bus I have ever traveled on.  Power points, Wi-Fi, bathroom and inline entertainment.</p>  
			<p>Unfortunately I packed the laptop power cord in my big bag which of course is stowed in the belly of the bus.  I write until the battery on the computer flashes its last warning and the screen goes blank.  By this time we have crossed into Germany and the gigantic props on the many wind turbines lining the highway have me completely enthralled with their majestic movement.</p>
